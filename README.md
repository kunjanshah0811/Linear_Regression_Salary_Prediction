# Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression

This repository contains code for predicting salaries based on years of experience using simple linear regression.

## Overview

The code provided in this repository demonstrates how to train a simple linear regression model to predict salaries based on the number of years of experience. It includes:

- Loading a dataset of salaries and years of experience.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training a linear regression model on the training data.
- Evaluating the model's performance on the testing data.
- Visualizing the results using matplotlib.

## Getting Started
